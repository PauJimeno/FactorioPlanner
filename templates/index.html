            <h2>What is Factorio Planner?</h2>
            <p>
                Factorio planner is a tool developed using SMT technology with the Python API of Z3, a state of the art
                SMT solver.
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of the tool is to find the optimal arrangement of assemblers, inserters and conveyor belts
                to maximize the output of the desired items to produce, the planner can also find layouts that minimize
                the number of conveyors and inserters used, and can also minimize the item loss due to conveyors
                accumulating unused items.
            </p>

            <h2>How do I use the tool?</h2>
            <p>
                The inputs needed to generate an instance are the input cells and their carrying items, you'll also need
                to select the recipe that produces the desired item you want to produce, and the cell that the final
                items will exit the blueprint.
                Finally, once you entered all the input information the instance can be attempted to be solved. If the
                solver finds a solution, the solved instance will be saved to later be visualized.

                The website is split in two parts, the instance generation and solving, and the instance visualization,
                this two parts can be accessed from the menu on the left.
